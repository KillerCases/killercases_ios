Szmu Pharma has a popular Beta Blocker drug, known as BetaB.  This is designed to prevent heart disease and improve the heart's ability to relax. Patent protection has now expired and Szmu Pharma expects many �generic� copies of the drug to come to market.  The chemical composition and efficacy of these drugs will be very similar to BetaB, but they will be sold at much lower cost under different trade names. Szmu Parma needs to decide whether to (A) drop the price of BetaB, (B) introduce their own generic alternative or (C) do nothing.
