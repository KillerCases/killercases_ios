	<p>Management believes there is an opportunity to capitalize on the green credentials of the business to command higher prices. How could this be achieved?</p>

		<h3>Answer 2</h3>
	</div>

	<div class = 'panel'>
		<h4>Basic Points</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Consumer demand for renewable energy solutions is reasonably high</li>
			<li>Currently quite difficult to buy renewable energy direct due to the disintegrated nature of the electricity supply chain.  Electricity cannot be bought directly from one particular source. It goes into a pool which cannot be separated out.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class = 'panel'>
		<h4>Advanced Comments</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><u>Direct to Consumer</u>: Potential to create a direct supply arrangement in areas local to the energy production facilities.   In practice this would be difficult to achieve and would probably involve building some direct transmission infrastructure.  In addition, would still need to be connected to "the grid" so that additional energy could be bought and sold on days when capacity was high/low.  It would also require that local people would be willing to pay a premium for electricity direct from a renewable source.</li>
			<br>
			<li><u>Ingredient Brand Strategy</u>: Form partnership with energy retailers offering a "renewable energy plan".  Under this plan, consumers would pay an additional fee to the energy supplier in return for an agreement that a portion of the energy is coming from renewable sources.  This requires careful internal administration by the power company.</li>
			<br>
			<li><u>Regulated Schemes</u>: Many US states operate a Renewable Energy Credit scheme.  An REC represents the exclusive legal right to claim that a unit of energy, typically 1MWH physically metered and verified, was generated from a renewable source. These RECs can often be sold for cash value.  RECs are sold into the compliance market or voluntary market.  The compliance market is typically comprised of utilities and generators who are under governmental mandates to produce and/or sell a certain amount of renewable energy.  As such, the value of an REC is highly sensitive to changes in government regulation that mandate demand.</li><br>
			<li><u>Context </u>: General difficultly in differentiating renewable energy at the point of consumption may be one cause for the slow development of this segment</li>
