    <p><u>Commodities</u> are defined as products that have no qualitative differentiation across the market.  Typical products include: basic resources (iron ore, crude oil, salt, aluminium, gold, silver), agricultural products (sugar, coffee beans, soy beans) and energy (gas, electricity, coal and oil).  Pricing is entirely driven by the aggregate demand and supply in the market.  For products that can easily be transported, this quickly creates a global market.</p>
    <p>Commodity markets are often subject to cyclical price swings. When prices are high this attracts new entrants and vice versa.  However, participants take time to enter/leave the market which delays market effects.</p>
    <p><u>Commoditization</u> (also called commodification) occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the intellectual capital necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium margins for market participants have become commodities, such as generic pharmaceuticals and silicon chips.</p>
    <p>There is a spectrum of commodification, rather than a binary distinction of &quot;commodity versus differentiable product&quot;. Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar). Many products' degree of commodification depends on the buyer's mentality and means.</p>
