  <p><u>Definition:</u> Venture Capital is a subset of Private Equity.  It involves lending money to early stage technology or pharmaceutical companies with high growth potential.  This is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering.</p>
  <p>Because early stage companies involve significant risk (many fail to realize their potential) Venture Capital investors target annual returns of approx 40%.</p>
