  <p>Multiples Valuation is a quick and easy way to determine the current value of a company.  A multiple expresses the Enterprise Value of a company, compared to EBITA, EBIT or Revenue.  If you are trying to find the value of a company, start by determining the relevant metrics from a peer group.  Then apply these multiples to the EBIT/EBITDA or Revenue of the company in question.</p>
  <p>e.g. Trying to value a regional beverage producer.  EV/EBITDA multiples of competing companies range from 3x to 5x.  Decide whether all of these are appropriate compariables (i.e. some comparable companies may engage in other business activities which affect their valuation).  Choose appropriate EV/EBITDA multiple and apply to the EV of company in question</p>
