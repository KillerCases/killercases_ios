  <p><u>Definition:</u> Although often used synonymously, the terms Merger and Acquisition mean slightly different things. When one company takes over another and clearly establishes itself as the new owner, the purchase is called an acquisition. From a legal point of view, the target company ceases to exist, the buyer &quot;swallows&quot; the business and the buyer's stock continues to be traded.</p>
  <p>In the pure sense of the term, a merger happens when two firms agree to go forward as a single new company rather than remain separately owned and operated. This kind of action is more precisely referred to as a &quot;merger of equals&quot;. The firms are often of about the same size. Both companies' stocks are surrendered and new company stock is issued in its place.   In practice, however, actual mergers of equals don't happen very often.</p>
  <p>Acquisitions make sense strategically when a company is trying to grow fast, enter a new market or acquire capabilities that will create a barrier to entry.  As a fast growing market matures, there is likely to be consolidation of players facilitated by a series of acquisitions.</p>
  <p><u>Interview Tip</u> In practice you are unlikely to be asked to value a company for the purpose of an acquisition during an interview (in fact consultants do not do this much).  However, there are two main methods to be aware of (a) Multiples and (b) Discounted Cash Flow.  These are described under a separate listing.</p>
