  <p><u>Definition:</u> Fixed Costs are business expenses that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business.</p>
  <p>Examples include Salaries, Marketing, Research and Development, Utilities, Rent or Leasing Costs.</p>
  <p>They tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents being paid per month, and are often referred to as overhead costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are volume-related (and are paid per quantity produced).</p>
