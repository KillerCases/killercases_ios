  <p><u>Definition:</u> Price Elasticity is the variation in demand resulting from changes in price.</p>
  <p>This is a key issue for all businesses to understand as pricing offers an easy opportunity to increase revenue.</p>
  <p>Price elasticity may vary by product, customer segment and time of purchase.  Some companies use &quotdifferential pricing&quot to exploit differences in price elasticity.  For example, if you buy a can of coke at a convenience store you will pay more than at a super market. </p>
