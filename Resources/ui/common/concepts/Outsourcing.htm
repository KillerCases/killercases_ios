  <p><u>Definition:</u> Outsourcing is the contracting out of a business function - commonly one previously performed in-house - to an external provider.</p>
  <p>The decision involves a trade off between cost and efficiency on one hand, and control of quality or intellectual property on the other hand.  If a function is considered to be core of the value of the product/service on offer then outsourcing is unlikely.</p>
  <p>E.g. Unlikely to outsource Research and Development for silicon chip design.  However, if the function is peripheral to the main product/service then outsourcing is more likely e.g. After sales support for Personal Computers.</p>
