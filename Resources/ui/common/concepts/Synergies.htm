  <p><u>Revenue Synergy:</u> The opportunity of a combined corporate entity to generate more revenue than its two predecessor stand-alone companies would be able to generate. For example, if company A sells product X through its sales force, company B sells product Y, and company A decides to buy company B then the new company could use each sales person to sell products X and Y thereby increasing the revenue that each sales person generates for the company.</p>
  <p><u>Cost Synergy:</u> The opportunity of a combined corporate entity to reduce or eliminate expenses associated with running a business. e.g. Headcount, Plant and Equipment.</p>
