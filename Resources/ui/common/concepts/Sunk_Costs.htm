  <p><u>Definition:</u> Sunk Costs are retrospective costs which have already been incurred and cannot be recovered.  These should not factor into forward looking business decisions.</p>
  <p>e.g. just because you spent $XM on developing a product over 10 years, does not mean you should continue to market and distribute that product if the ongoing NPV is negative</p>
