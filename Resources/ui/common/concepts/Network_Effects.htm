  <p><u>Definition:</u> Network Effects are factors which make the value of a good or service increase as more people use it.</p>
  <p>With Direct Network Effects an increase in usage leads to a direct increase in value.  The classic examples include fax machines and online social networks.</p>
  <p>With Indirect Network Effects an increase in usages spawns the production of increasingly valuable complementary goods.  For example, the iPhone App Store has led to the development of apps by 3rd party developers.  These add to the value of the iPhone product.</p>
