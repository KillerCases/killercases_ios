  <p><u>Definition:</u> A Cooperative is a business organization owned and operated by a group of individuals for their mutual benefit.</p>
  <p>It is fairly rare to find large corporations with this ownership structure, but examples include John Lewis (UK retailer) and a handful of traditional Building Societies that have not de-mutualized.</p>
