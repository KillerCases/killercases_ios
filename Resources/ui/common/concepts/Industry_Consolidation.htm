  <p><u>Definition:</u> Consolidation is the number of different players in an industry.  If there are only a few players then consolidation is high.  If there are many players then fragmentation is high.</p>
  <p>Over a period of time, industries typically become more consolidated and less fragmented.  However, the degree of consolidation will always depend on structural factors of competitiveness.</p>
  <p>e.g. Restaurant industry is relatively fragmented and competitive because it is hard to establish barriers to entry.  By comparison energy generation is highly consolidated because there are scale advantages in production.</p>
