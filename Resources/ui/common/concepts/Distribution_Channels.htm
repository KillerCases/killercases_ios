  <p><u>Definition:</u> A Distribution Channel is a path through which goods and services flow in one direction (from vendor to the consumer), and the payments generated by them flow in the opposite direction (from consumer to the vendor).</p>
  <p>A distribution channel can be as short as being direct from the vendor to the consumer or may include several interconnected intermediaries such as wholesalers, distributors, agents, retailers. Each intermediary receives the item at one pricing point and moves it to the next higher pricing point until it reaches the final buyer.</p>
  <p>Distribution channels present many opportunities for businesses â€“ more sales volume (increase channels), price differentiation (via separation of distribution channels) and reduction in costs (reduce intermediaries in the chain).</p>
