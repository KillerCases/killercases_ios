  <p>Product Growth and Expansion Strategies should consider the Product, Market Strategy, Customers and Financing.</p>
  <p><u>Product</u> Whatâ€™s special or proprietary? Is the product patentable? Are there any similar products out there? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the product?  How does this product fit with the rest of our product line?</p>
  <p><u>Market Strategy</u> How does this affect our existing product line? Are we cannibalizing one of our existing products? Are we replacing an existing product? How will this expand our customer base and increase sales? What will the competitive response be? What are the barriers to entering this market? Who are the major players and how much market share does each firm have?</p>
  <p><u>Customers</u> Who are our customers? How can we best reach them? Can we reach them through the internet? How can we ensure we retain them?</p>
  <p><u>Financing</u> How will the project be financed? What is the best allocation of funds? Can we support the debt?</p>
