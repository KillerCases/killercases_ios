  <p><u>Definition:</u> Cross-selling is the action of selling an additional product or service to an existing customer.</p>
  <p>In retail, an example of cross selling would be when you come into a convenience store to buy a newspaper and come out with a chocolate bar as well.  In banking, it might mean selling an insurance product to an existing current account holder.</p>
  <p>Unlike the acquiring of new business, cross-selling involves an element of risk that existing relationships with the client could be disrupted. For this reason, it is important to ensure that the additional product or service being sold enhances value for the client.</p>
  <p>In practice, large businesses usually combine cross-selling and up-selling techniques.</p>
