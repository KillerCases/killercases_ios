  <p><u>Definition:</u> Differentiation is unique qualities, perceived or real, that distinguish a good or service from a competing offer.</p>
  <p>For example, a consumer products company may develop a razor with an additional blade and advertise that it produces a closer shave.</p>
  <p>Companies use differentiation in order to improve sales and/or charge a higher price.</p>
