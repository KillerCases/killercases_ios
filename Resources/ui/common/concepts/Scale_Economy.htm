  <p><u>Definition:</u> Scale Economy is the concept that as volumes increase, costs decrease.</p>
  <p> This is the result of a combination of factors:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fixed Costs do not increase at the same rate as Variable Costs</li>
    <li>With more volume comes more experience of how to do things more efficiently.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Common sources of Scale Economies are purchasing (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-interest charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), marketing (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in media markets) and technological (taking advantage of returns to scale in the production function).</p>
